# Rules

Every DAO must have rules that ensure the mission and values are not lost over time. Yet it is equally important that rules not be encumbering to the DAO in ways that prevent it from operating efficiently or accomplishing its intended goals as the situation and environment may change over time.

The rules are divided into two main categories to accomplish these goals:

● Constitutional Rules - These rules enforce the guiding principles and every proposal must adhere to them. The rules presented are limited to essentials, not every possible situation. Changing these rules is possible, but designed to be very difficult and only with widespread approval by the community.

● Soft Rules - These rules are designed to have much more coverage of different scenarios that may arise and offer guidelines that can be safely followed word-for-word, in most cases. However, certain situations may necessitate exceptions to be made.

For example, a soft rule exists that a proposal must have milestones within a certain period. However, the nature of the project is deemed to be impossible within the constraints of this period. In this case, the representatives can opt to make an exception to the rule, specifically for this proposal. This allows for reasonable flexibility as long as the intention of the rule is not violated.

Bending of a soft rule can be done by a formal vote or by informal consensus among the representitives. In the case of the later, discussion must occur in public view. This should be considered part of the public records of the DAO.

## 1. Representative Voting Types
There are two primary types of voting that can be used to make decisions within the DAO.

1. Formal Vote - A formal vote is a vote that is conducted on the DAO governance platform using a weighted voting system. Votes are cast by representatives and CKB holders, generally requiring a 51% majority to pass. Formal votes are required for all the major decisions of the DAO.
1. Informal Consensus - Informal consensus is a vote that is conducted in public between representatives. The vote does not use a weighted voting system, and instead relies on general consensus of the representitives within a public forum or public chat. This allows for time-sensitive decisions to be made on minor issues. Informal votes are considered to be part of the public record of the DAO so that representatives can be held accountable for their decisions.

## 2. Constitutional Rules
1. CKB holders must always be allowed to express their viewpoints on issues of governance and treasury spending without restriction.
1. CKB holders must never lose the ability to overrule the vote of any representatives of the community in cases of widespread disagreement.
1. CKB holdings must be taken into consideration in regards to voting power determination.
1. Grant requests must always be done with the intention of benefiting the community, either directly or indirectly.
1. Changes to the constitutional rules can only be made with a supermajority of 75% of the voting power, and participation of at least 80% of the delegated voting power.
1. Changes to the soft rules can only be made with a majority of 60% of the voting power, and participation of at least 60% of the delegated voting power.

## 3. Soft Rules

### 3.1. Grant Proposals

1. Grant proposals must attach a fee of 10,000 CKB in order to be considered. The fee amount should be adjusted periodically to reflect the current market conditions. The fee is paid into the DAO treasury and is returned if and only if the funding proposal is approved.
1. Grant proposals must undergo an initial grant screening by designated DAO screener. The screening process is to make recommendations to the proposer to improve the quality and reception of the proposal. The screening process is not binding, and the proposer is free to ignore all recommendations. If a proposal is cancelled during the screening period, 50% of the fee is returned to the proposer.
1. Grant proposals must have a pre-voting period of at least 7 days, and a voting period of exactly 7 days. Pre-voting is a period where the proposal is visible in the system, but cannot be voted on. If a proposal is cancelled during the pre-voting period, 50% of the fee is returned to the proposer.
1. Grant proposals valued at over $5,000 USD that are technical in nature must undergo a feasibility review by a DAO designated technical reviewer. This review must be completed during the pre-voting period, before the proposal can go to voting.
1. Grant proposals valued at over $10,000 USD must be broken down into milestones. Each milestone must have a clear definition of what is to be achieved and a timeline for completion. Upon completion of each milestone, the DAO must be notified and the milestone must be approved by a DAO designated project reviewer.
1. Each grant milestone must not exceed 33.33% of the total value of the grant.

### 3.2. DAO Oversight and Review Timelines

1. The grant proposal fee must be re-evaluated at least once per year or whenever volatility in the CKB price changes by more than 50%.
1. Grant proposal screening must be completed by a designated DAO screener in 7 days or less, with strong recommendation that it occur within 3 days.
1. Grant proposal feasibility review must be completed by a designated DAO technical reviewer in 7 days or less, with strong recommendation that it occur within 3 days.
1. Grant proposal project review must be completed by a designated DAO project reviewer in 7 days or less, with strong recommendation that it occur within 3 days.

### 3.3. Public Funding Policies

1. Public funding implies public code. Every project that received grant funding must agree to open source the Nervos specific portions of the project. This is typically smart contract code, and transaction generation code. It does not include the project's complete codeebase.
1. Projects that receive grant funding in excess of $50,000 USD must agree to provide a reasonable means for the Nervos community to persist the project if the team chooses to abandon it. In most cases the most simple way to accomplish this is to transfer the full source code and all relevant data, accounts, and rights, to a community team that can takeover operation of the project. If a suitable team cannot be found, the project must be open sourced completely.
1. Projects that sell virtual assets must agree to provide a reasonable means for the Nervos community to persist said assets if the team chooses to abandon it. Failing to do so is considered a breach of contract, gross negligence, and destruction of personal property.
1. Projects that receive a down payment but show little to no progress after 12-months must return the full amount of the down payment to the DAO treasury. Projects can request an extension which is decided by DAO vote. Projects that return the full amount of the down payment remain elegible to submit new grant proposals.
1. Projects that fail to meet the requirements of the public funding policies must return the full amount of the grant to the DAO treasury within 90 days of the violation. Projects that are in violation and fail to repay the grant within the 90 day period are subject to pursuit of legal action.

### 3.4. Voting Restrictions

1. Entities which custodially hold assets for other individuals may not vote or delegate their voting power on behalf of those individuals. This includes but is not limited to custodial wallets, exchanges, and or investment funds.
1. Grant applicants may not attempt to coerce voters by offering them a share of the grant funding, or by offering to give them any other form of compensation in exchange for their vote.

### 3.5. Conflict of Interest Disclosures

1. Participants in review or decision-making roles (e.g., Proposal Screeners, Technical Reviewers, Project Reviewers, Treasurers, Vault Guardians, Auditors, Representatives) must publicly disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest before undertaking their duties.
1. Disclosures must be updated promptly upon any change in status and must be made publicly viewable on the DAO platform.

### 3.6. Dispute Resolution Process

- TBD
