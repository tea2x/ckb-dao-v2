# Mission & Values

## 1. Introduction

A community DAO is a step towards creating a sustainable catalyst for growth in a decentralized ecosystem. It is also a precursor to community governance of a decentralized ecosystem.

This initiative aims to create a second community DAO that builds off of the original community DAO with meaningful changes that will lead it to a higher rate of success.

## 2. Mission and Values

To empower the community to become a driving force behind ecosystem growth by defining a framework for decentralized governance.

To facilitate a successful community effort, we must adopt and adhere to a set of core values.

● Transparency - Any process that is not transparent is subject to centralization and corruption. Our process must keep all aspects of the process as public and accessible as possible.

● Accountability - Those who make decisions for the ecosystem must remain accountable for the results. Recipients of grants must remain accountable to deliver on their commitments.

● Sustainability - The process must avoid waste in the form of overhead costs, ineffective spending, or fraud. Mistakes will be made, but they must be minimized and recoverable.

● Efficiency - This process must prevent bureaucracy from creeping in, keeping the process streamlined and effective to remain sustainable.

The technology we are building minimizes trust and enables higher levels of transparency. We should take advantage of this whenever it is beneficial, but never for the sake of using the technology. Adopting technology without necessity leads to unnecessary complexity and overhead, which must be avoided.

## 3. Key Challenges and Solutions

The primary challenge is not one of technology, but one of humans working together. This is the same challenge that has persisted throughout all of human history without a perfect solution. Fixing humanity’s greatest challenges is far beyond the scope of the DAO, but we can use this knowledge to build a better system in the interest of the community.

We should expect that the DAO will not be a perfect solution. It is inevitable that mistakes will be made. What is more important is that failures are minimized and that recovery from these failures is always possible by the community at large.

We learned many things from the original CKB Community Fund DAO about the challenges that exist:

Community member participation is low. Most community members do not want to spend time reading proposals. The time it takes to participate is high, and there is no direct or immediate benefit to the individual. It is not realistic to expect higher participation without meaningful changes.

Solutions: Vote power delegation combined with incentives will increase total participation. Most community members will choose to delegate their vote power to representatives that they trust to vote in their interest. Incentives to the representatives will come from the DAO when they participate.

Community experience and knowledge is low. The community members who do participate often do not have the experience or knowledge needed to make important decisions. They are unable to understand the benefit-to-cost ratio of what has been proposed. They are unable to make character judgments and uncover red flags from those requesting grants. They lack the technical knowledge to be able to evaluate the components that have been proposed or need to be reviewed.

Solutions: Community members should be allowed to be part of the conversation, but the decisions will be made by representatives and/or technical experts hired by the DAO for evaluation.

Ease of use is fundamentally critical. Those who desire to exercise their vote are easily deterred by complex procedures or lack of support in wallets.

Solutions: Easier solutions are critical for participation. All ecosystem wallets with significant use will need a method of support delegation and voting. Any linking process must be streamlined to a single step.

Lockup deters participation with traders. Community members who are long-term holders but actively trade due to volatility will not use the Nervos DAO due to the 30-day lock. They will not participate in a process that requires locking.

Solutions: The interest rate of ~2% and voting rights are not enough for many of our ecosystem participants to sacrifice liquidity. Enabling voting with liquid tokens, even if at a lower power threshold, will increase participation.

Grant execution requires incentives. After a grant has been approved by the community, milestone review and payments must be executed. These actions are currently being handled by a privileged individual whose efforts are supported by ecosystem companies. This is problematic because it is an area of centralized trust and is undefined for long-term sustainability.

Solutions: The DAO will need to have assigned roles and responsibilities, and a procedure for filling and compensating these roles.

Stablecoin accounting and payments are necessary. CKB volatility is far too high for it to be a preferred payment mechanism. Businesses that operate on expected revenue cannot operate on long-duration projects that require milestones when volatility is high. Attempting to force them into contracts that operate exclusively with CKB will not work. The volatility creates scenarios where they are either overcompensated or undercompensated; the former being less problematic, but the latter results in project abandonment.

Solutions: The option should be given on grant requests for either CKB or USD pricing. Once the decision is made, they cannot change it later on. This policy should be reinvestigated periodically to see if better alternatives have become available.

Bias exists between the Chinese and English-speaking communities. The language barriers between the two communities are well-known and problematic to solve. Nuances of communication are lost through language barriers, written language inefficiencies, and differences in expectations in cultural norms. Differences also exist in the interest of the markets between the two. When this is all taken into account, it is not surprising that bias has been observed where community members favor proposals in their native language, and mistrust those in a foreign language.

Solutions: Representatives will be needed from both sides of the community to demonstrate inclusive representation.

Community participation is inadequate to enable DAO policy changes. Because of the aforementioned problems with participation, collecting adequate votes to pass a rule change is not possible. This is evidenced by the community unanimously voting in favor of changing the payment policy from CKB to USD two separate times and failing to pass the voting participation threshold requirement both times.

Solutions: Delegated or appointed representatives will make these decisions on behalf of the community. The threshold for activation of policy changes is a higher majority of voting power. Minimum voting power not being a requirement because representatives are used.
