# Community Roles

## 1. Introduction

This document describes community roles that the Community Fund DAO could fund after the Nervos Foundation's dissolution. It is intended to be a starting point for envisioning how structures and roles would exist in a more concrete and realistic sense, but it is not a formal recommendation.

All roles funded through the DAO must answer to the community as the highest authority, with representatives acting on their behalf. No roles in the DAO should ever be an automatic renewal. All roles must be reapplied for and voted on each year by the community.

## 2. Open Questions

- How is voter fatigue prevented during contract renewal season?
- Is annual renewal realistic for teams that work on projects with a multi-year agenda?
